### What is Sentiment Analysis ? üòä üò† üòû
- Sentiment analysis is extremely useful in social media monitoring as it allows us to gain an overview of the wider public opinion behind certain topics.
- The applications of sentiment analysis are broad and powerful. The ability to extract insights from social data is a practice that is being widely adopted by organisations across the world.

### What is NLP(Natural Language Processing) ?
- Natural Language Processing, or NLP for short, is broadly defined as the automatic manipulation of natural language, like speech and text, by software.
- The rules that dictate the passing of information using natural languages are not easy for computers to understand.
- Some of these rules can be high-leveled and abstract; for example, when someone uses a sarcastic remark to pass information.
- On the other hand, some of these rules can be low-levelled; for example, using the character ‚Äús‚Äù to signify the plurality of items.
- Comprehensively understanding the human language requires understanding both the words and how the concepts are connected to deliver the intended message.
